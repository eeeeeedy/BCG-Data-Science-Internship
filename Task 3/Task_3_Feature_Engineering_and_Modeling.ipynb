    "1. **Normalization**: Given that the consumption levels might vary significantly across customers, it might be beneficial to normalize this feature by the customerâ€™s average monthly consumption.\n",

    "2. **Business Understanding**: Features like `margin_net_pow_ele` and `margin_gross_pow_ele` could be directly related to customer satisfaction and, therefore, churn. Similarly, the number of years a customer has been with the company (`num_years_antig`) could be an indicator of loyalty and lower likelihood to churn.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **ROC AUC Score**: A minor improvement in the ROC AUC score from 0.52 to 0.5685 indicates that the model's ability to distinguish between the churn and non-churn cases has improved slightly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Precision and F1-Score**: The precision for identifying churn is still low, and so is the F1-score. This suggests that while the model is identifying more churn cases, it's also misclassifying non-churn cases as churn (False Positives).\n",

    "    - Accuracy: ~88.4%, ROC AUC: 0.52\n",

    "    - Accuracy: ~79%, ROC AUC: 0.56\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation of Model Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "The model primarily underperformed in the following areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Low Precision for Churn**: Across all variations of the model, precision for identifying churn remained low, hovering around 18%. This indicates that the model is flagging a large number of false positives, i.e., predicting that customers will churn when they actually will not. This could lead to unnecessary costs if these customers are targeted with retention efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Moderate Recall after SMOTE and Tuning**: Although the recall for the churn class improved with SMOTE and hyperparameter tuning, it reached only about 27-29%. This means that the model is still missing a significant number of customers who end up churning. This could lead to lost revenue and increased customer acquisition costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ROC AUC Score**: The ROC AUC score remained moderate (0.56) even after hyperparameter tuning. This metric indicates the model's ability to distinguish between the churn and non-churn classes, and an ideal score would be close to 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Trade-Off in Accuracy**: The accuracy of the model decreased after using SMOTE, from approximately 88.4% to around 79%. While this was expected due to the balancing of classes, it's a trade-off that may not be acceptable in all business contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these underperformances has implications for customer retention and the cost effectiveness of any retention campaigns the business may undertake.\n",
    "#### Advantages and Disadvantages of Random Forest:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advantages**:\n",
    "    1. Handles imbalanced classes reasonably well.\n",
    "    2. Good for both categorical and numerical features.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Disadvantages**:\n",
    "    1. Complex and not easily interpretable.\n",
    "    2. Computationally intensive for hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Performance Satisfaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "The model's performance is not entirely satisfactory. Although recall improved with SMOTE and hyperparameter tuning, precision remained low. The model still struggles with identifying churn accurately, leading to a high number of false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bonus: Financial Implication\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions**:\n",
    "1. Cost to retain a customer through discounts is 70% less than acquiring a new one.\n",
    "2. False positives will also receive the discount, incurring a cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the model, especially the one after hyperparameter tuning, the client can target a larger subset of customers who are more likely to churn and offer them discounts to retain them. However, the low precision means we'll also be offering discounts to customers who wouldn't have churned, thereby incurring some loss. A more balanced recall and precision would make the model more financially beneficial for the client."
