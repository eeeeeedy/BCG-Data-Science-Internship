# Forage BCG - PowerCo - Data Science Internship Project

# Project Title & Description

### PowerCo Churn Analysis & Prediction
This repository contains the work completed during a virtual internship at PowerCo, provided by Forage BCG. The project focuses on analyzing customer churn among PowerCo's SME customers and developing a predictive model to identify high-risk customers. The aim is to inform a targeted discount strategy to retain these customers.

# Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing
Hypothesis formulated: "SME customers with higher sensitivity to price changes are more likely to churn." A predictive model was planned to forecast customer churn based on various features, focusing on indicators of price sensitivity. <a href="https://github.com/eeeeeedy/BCG-Data-Science-Internship/tree/main/Task%201" target="_blank">Read more here</a>.


### Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
The initial exploration of the data was conducted to identify patterns, anomalies, or other insights. The analysis focused on understanding the relationship between customer features and their churn rates. <a href="https://github.com/eeeeeedy/BCG-Data-Science-Internship/tree/main/Task%202" target="_blank">Read more here</a>.

### Task 3: Feature Engineering & Modelling
Various features were engineered to train a predictive model. Machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest were used. <a href="https://github.com/eeeeeedy/BCG-Data-Science-Internship/tree/main/Task%203" target="_blank">Read more here</a>.

### Task 4: Findings & Recommendations
A predictive model was developed to identify customers at high risk of churning. The model aims to inform a targeted discount strategy, particularly a 20% discount to retain these high-risk customers. <a href="https://github.com/eeeeeedy/BCG-Data-Science-Internship/tree/main/Task%204" target="_blank">Read more here</a>.
